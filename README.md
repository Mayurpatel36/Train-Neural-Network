# Train-Neural-Network
The task is to code and train a neural network in Python using only NumPy.
That is, the only library imported is NumPy.

# The network architecture
The network has three fully connected weight layers, three inputs and three-class softmax output. 
The first hidden layer has four neurons and the second eight neurons. 
All neurons have a single bias. 

The goal of this exercise is to get an accuracy above 90% in less than 10 epochs of training.
